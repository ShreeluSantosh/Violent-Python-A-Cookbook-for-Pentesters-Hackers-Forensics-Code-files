This code is purely meant for learning purposes, and not meant to be used for malicious intent.

## About

This is a Python module that allows one to connect to a specified port on a server.

In the code sample `Connect-socket.py`, I used the IP address of intentionally vulnerable website <a>certifiedhacker.com</a> and its port 21 to connect.

## Output

I get this output, indicating a successful connection:
```
b'220---------- Welcome to Pure-FTPd [privsep] [TLS] ----------\r\n220-You are user number 1 of 150 allowed.\r\n220-Local time is now 08:38. Server port: 21.\r\n220-IPv6 connections are also welcome on this server.\r\n220 You will be disconnected after 15 minutes of inactivity.\r\n'
```
