## About

We can view the contents of a compressed zip folder on Windows Explorer, but when you try to open a file within the zip folder, you'll get this dialog box: <br>

If you don't know the password, but you have a dictionary of passwords ready for brute-forcing, then this program will be the tool for you.

This Python program usese many modules and libraries, namely:
1. `zipfile` - to extract contents from a zip file
2. `os` - to get the path of the current working directory (optional, can be skipped)
3. `threading` - for increasing performance by using threads to allow simultaneous testing of multiple passwords

There are two code samples - basic and threading-based. The basic sample uses first 2 libraries but it tries one password in the dictionary each time
The other sample uses threading module to createn separate threads for each password; that way, performance is better, as a thread is created for each password.

## Testing

I first created a simple text document, named `hidden.txt' with the following content (similar to a CTF flag):
```
flag(SUCC3SS_ZIP_FIL3_P4SSW0RD_CR4CK3D)
```

Then I used 7-Zip to create a zip file named `evil.zip` with `hidden.txt`as its contents. 7-Zip allows us to set a password while creating the zip file. Here, I've set `secret` as the password for the zip file.

## Output

```
[+] Password = secret
[+] The contents of the zip file can be viewed in this directory:
