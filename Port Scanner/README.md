# CLI-based Port Scanner

### Chapter - 2 : Penetration Testing with Python
#### Code : Building a Port Scanner

## Disclaimer

This code is purely meant for learning purposes, and not meant to be used with malicious intent.

## About

This is a more exciting program compared to codes in Chapter 1, as this is about building a CLI-based port scanner.

The libraries used here are:
1. optparse - to enable command-line arguments in the terminal and their parsing
2. socket - to interact with the host and their ports

This port scanner is TCP-based.

## Output

On using the help option, we get the following output:
```
Usage: port-scanner.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H TGHOST, --Host=TGHOST
                        specify target host
  -p TGPORT, --port=TGPORT
                        specify target port[s] separated by comma
```

After entering a valid IP address for `certifiedhacker.com` and 3 ports - namely 21, 22, 80, the following output is displayed:
```
