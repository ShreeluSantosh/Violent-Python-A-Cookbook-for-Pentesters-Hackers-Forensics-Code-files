## About

This code is basically a password cracker for UNIX passwords

The original code program in the book used crypt library, but when I tried running the code sample (in Interpreter mode), I got an error: 

"ImportError: The crypt module is not supported on Windows"

On Googling, I found that crypt library was deprecated in Python 3.11 and was removed in Python 3.13.

So I used hashlib, a popular Python package for secure hashes and message digests.

The updated code sample is in `CodeSample-1.py` file. And the final program is `UNIX-password-cracker.py` file.

The hashing algorithm I used here is SHA-1, whereas SHA-216 and SHA-512 are used in many real-world applications.

## Testing

For testing purposes, I created a `passwords.txt` file to mimic the passwords file stored in UNIX systems. I used `CodeSample-1.py` to generated hashed passwords for 5 users.

Also, I created a small `dictionary.py` file for this test. Note that actual dictionary lists used by hackers for brute-forcing passwords are much longer.
